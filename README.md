# ADY - Movement Schedules

Azerbaijan Railways - Application CLI application for Baku Sumgait traffic schedule



# Usage rule
`$ python ady.py` will give you the desired result through arguments

`$ python ady.py -h` for help

`$ python ady.py` argumentləri:

`$ python ady.py [-b] [--baku] [--bakı] [-s] [--sum] [--sumgait] [--sumqayıt] [-a] [--all] [--ha] [--hamısı]`

# Why?
Every day, I use Baku Railway Station for Sumgayit Baku. I had to look at the table every time I went out at different times. While doing ady.az, it took some time to do so (opening a site -> moving schedule -> click on it, etc.). To accelerate the work, and almost everyday, we have prepared this as a shorter way to use the Terminal.
