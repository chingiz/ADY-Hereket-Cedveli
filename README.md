# ADY - Timetable
Azerbaijan Railways - Baku Sumgayit Baku is a CLI application to see the traffic schedule.



# How to use
`$ python ady.py` will produce the desired result using the arguments

`$ python ady.py -h` for help

Arguments `$ python ady.py`:

`$ python ady.py [-b] [--baku] [--baky] [-s] [--sum] [--sumgait] [--a] [--all] [- -ha] [- All] `

# Why?
Every day I use the Railway Station for Baku Sumgayit Baku. Since I was at different times, I had to look at the table each time. And on ady.az it took some time (opening the site -> finding a schedule -> clicking the details, etc.). We have prepared this as a shorter way to speed things up and as I use the terminal almost every time.
