# ADY - Movement Schedules
Azerbaijan Railways - Application CLI application for Baku Sumgait traffic schedule.



# Usage Procedure
`$ python ady.py` will give you the desired result through the arguments

`$ python ady.py -h` to help

`$ python ady.py` arguments:

`$ python ady.py [-b] [-baku] [-bak] [-s] [-sum] [-sumgait] [-sumqayÄ±t] [-a] [--all] [- -ha] [-]`

# Why?
Every day, I use Baku Railway Station for Sumgayit Baku. I had to look at the table every time I went out at different times. While doing ady.az, it took some time to do so (opening a site -> moving schedule -> click on it, etc.). To accelerate the work, and almost everyday, we have prepared this as a shorter way to use the Terminal.
